# Handwritten Letter Recognition App 🖋️

A simple machine learning-based app that recognizes handwritten letters using a graphical interface. Draw a character, click **Predict**, and the app will identify it using a trained model.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** – for GUI
- **OpenCV** – image preprocessing
- **NumPy** – image data handling
- **Trained ML Model** – for character recognition
- **Jupyter Notebook** – run via Anaconda Navigator

## ✨ Features

- Draw characters on a canvas
- Predict the character using a trained model
- Save and clear drawings
- Simple and responsive GUI

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- Basic packages (usually included with Anaconda):
  - `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `Pillow`, `tensorflow` or `keras` (depending on your model)

### How to Run

1. Open **Anaconda Navigator**
2. Launch **Jupyter Notebook**
3. Open `your_notebook.ipynb`
4. Run all cells to start the GUI

### Controls

| Button   | Action                          |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| Save     | Saves your drawing              |
| Predict  | Runs model prediction           |
| Clear    | Clears the canvas               |
| Exit     | Closes the application          |

## 🧠 How It Works

- Canvas input is captured as a PIL image
- Preprocessed using OpenCV (grayscale, resized to 8x8, reshaped)
- Passed to a trained model (e.g., a neural network)
- Displays the predicted character label

## 🔍 Example Code Snippet

```python
img_array = cv2.cvtColor(img_array, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
img_array = cv2.resize(img_array, (8, 8))
img_array = img_array.reshape(1, 64)
result = model.predict(img_array)[0]
label = label_dict[result]
label_status.config(text='predicted character: ' + label)
